# Future Features & Ideas

A running list of features and improvements for future development. Items here are **not** committed to any timeline - just captured so we don't lose them.

## High Priority (Post-MVP)

### Value Forest Side Quest
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Medium-Large

Allow users to create, store, and maintain their personal Value Forest alongside annual reviews.

**Core concept:**
- Users define their 18 (or N) Value Trees
- Each tree has 4 layers:
  - **Roots** (Purpose) - Why this matters to you
  - **Trunk** (Values) - Core principles that guide this area
  - **Branches** (Outcomes/Resolves) - What you want to achieve
  - **Leaves** (Projects/Tasks) - Specific actions
- Forest persists across reviews (evolves year over year)
- Annual review can pull from/update the forest

**Implementation thoughts:**
- Could be a separate "Forest" section in the app
- Onboarding wizard to build initial forest
- Visualization of forest (literal tree/forest graphic?)
- Link review questions to specific Value Trees
- Track growth over time (how have your values/focus shifted?)

**References:**
- Henry's thrivinghenry.com Value Forest articles
- Task management angle: every task traces to purpose (no cognitive dissonance)

### AI-Assisted Reflection
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Large

Use LLM to help users deepen their reflections.

**Possible features:**
- Suggest follow-up questions based on answers
- Identify patterns across responses ("You mentioned energy 5 times in relation to...")
- Generate year summary/narrative from completed review
- Compare to previous years' reviews (if stored)
- "Coach mode" - Socratic dialogue to dig deeper

**Considerations:**
- Privacy implications (processing personal reflections)
- Opt-in only
- Could be premium feature
- Voice input option for more natural reflection

### Review Archive / History
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Medium

**Features:**
- View past completed reviews

- Track themes/words over years
- Progress on goals set in previous reviews
- "Time capsule" - letter to future self delivered at end of next year

### Birthday Lessons Review Template
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Small

A specialized template for reflecting on lessons learned around your birthday.

**Core concept:**
- "XX lessons from my YZ year" format (inspired by Henry's practice)
- Works well when birthday falls within annual review cycle
- Could be standalone or integrated into annual review flow
- More personal/celebratory tone than standard annual review

**Potential questions:**
- What did this year teach you about yourself?
- What surprised you about being [age]?
- What advice would you give to someone entering this year of their life?

### LinkedIn/Network Integration for "Who Can Help"
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Medium-Large

When users reach the "who can help me?" step, integrate with their network to surface connections.

**Possible features:**
- Connect LinkedIn/contacts
- Surface relevant connections based on goals/challenges written
- "You mentioned wanting to learn about X - here are connections who work in that area"
- Privacy-first: processing happens locally or with explicit consent

---

### Produced Video Content for Section Intros
**Status:** v2/v3 idea
**Complexity:** Large (content production)

Create video introductions for each section of the review, similar to TK Kader's approach.

**Concept:**
- Short (1-2 min) videos introducing each section
- Sets context and tone
- Could feature Henry or other creators explaining the "why" behind questions
- Optional - users can skip if they prefer text-only

---

### Seasonal Wheel of the Year Visualization
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Medium

Overlay energy audit on seasonal/natural cycles rather than just calendar weeks.

**Concept:**
- Visualize energy levels across the year as a wheel/circle
- Color-coded for energy states
- Zoom out from daily/weekly to seasonal patterns
- Help users see natural rhythms in their energy

**Inspiration:** Sahil Bloom's energy audit + seasonal/agricultural calendar traditions

## Notes

- Features should align with Henry's ethos: **thriving over achievement**, **systems over goals**, **invitational mastery**
- Avoid feature creep that adds complexity without genuine value
- Premium features should enhance, not gate, the core experience
- Privacy-first approach for all personal data
