### Chris Guillebeau (not a template - thought process)
**Source:** https://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review

**Core Framework:**
- Two foundational questions: "What went well?" and "What did not go well?"
- Generate 6-8 answers to each
- Only include outcomes you could actually influence (controllability principle)
- ~70-80% goal achievement is healthy (means you're being ambitious enough)

**Process:**
- Review previous year's goals in "Final Review" column
- Assess achievement level + understand why
- Category-based goal setting (Writing, Business, Health, Travel, Financial)
- 3-5 measurable goals per category
- "Required actions" column identifying necessary steps
- Year theme statement

**Key insight:** Simplicity + controllability + honesty

## Draft Architecture: Henry's Annual Review Template

### Design Principles
1. **Sparkline-informed** - Oscillate between "what is" (DOWN) and "what could be" (UP)
2. **Value Forest integrated** - Review centered on your 18 Value Trees
3. **Comprehensive** - Err on side of thorough (Gustin-style depth)
4. **Emotionally resonant** - Open warmly, process deeply, end with transformed commitment
5. **Language aligned** - Thriving, outcomes, resolves (not goals, success, targets)

### Proposed Flow (with Sparkline Mapping)

```
SECTION                          | ENERGY | SPARKLINE
─────────────────────────────────┼────────┼──────────

6. Synthesize: What's Draining   | DOWN ↓ | What Is
7. Value Forest Review           | MIXED  | Oscillating

### Mattias Frank (from HAF doc)
**Source:** https://matthiasfrank.notion.site/

**Unique Framework:** 2x2 grid (Past/Future × Introspection/Action)
- Past + Introspection = Reflect
- Past + Action = Learn from it
- Future + Introspection = Envision
- Future + Action = Plan

**Key Philosophy:**
- "The unexamined life is not worth living" - Sokrates
- "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate" - Jung
- Combats the "end-of-history illusion" - assumption that who you are now is who you'll remain

## Duarte Sparkline Analysis

**Source:** Nancy Duarte's "Resonate" framework ([TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks), [Duarte blog](https://www.duarte.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-contrast/))

### The Core Concept

The Sparkline is a visual representation of how great speeches and presentations alternate between two states:
- **"What Is"** (lower line) - The current reality, status quo, challenges, problems
- **"What Could Be"** (upper line) - The vision, possibility, aspiration, transformation

### How It Works

1. **Contrast creates tension** - The gap between "what is" and "what could be" should be as large as possible
2. **Oscillation maintains engagement** - You "tack" back and forth like a sailboat, not one straight line up
3. **The journey ends at "New Bliss"** - The transformed state where the audience has been persuaded to join you

### Visual Shape
```
          ╱╲      ╱╲      ╱╲   → NEW BLISS
"What    ╱  ╲    ╱  ╲    ╱  ╲  /
Could   ╱    ╲  ╱    ╲  ╱    ╲/
 Be"   ╱      ╲╱      ╲╱
      ↗
START  "What Is" (current reality)
      ────────────────────────→ TIME
```

### Famous Examples
- **MLK "I Have a Dream"**: Alternates between the harsh reality of segregation ("what is") and the vision of equality ("what could be")
- **Steve Jobs iPhone launch**: Current phone problems → revolutionary solution, repeated throughout

### Application to Annual Reviews

**Key Insight:** An annual review can follow this same emotional arc:
- "What Is" = Current state, challenges, energy drains, fears, misses
- "What Could Be" = Aspirations, transformed self, values alignment, thriving

**The oscillation could map to:**
1. Remember the highs (UP) → Acknowledge the lows (DOWN)
2. See current gaps (DOWN) → Envision ideal state (UP)
3. Face fears/obstacles (DOWN) → Commit to transformation (UP)
4. End at "New Bliss" = Clear vision for year ahead

## Template Flow Analysis (Emotional Sparklines)

### Gustin - The Comprehensive Audit
```
Emotional Arc: Neutral → Down → Mixed → Up → Resolved
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Housekeeping (neutral clean slate)                      │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Reflect (mixed - highs AND lows together)               │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Review Outcomes (potentially down - missed goals)       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Where You Are Now (confronting gaps - DOWN)             │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ What Do You Want (visioning - UP)                       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Action & Plan (grounded commitment - RESOLVED)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Linear progression, not oscillating. Front-loads reflection before vision.

### Tiago - The Memory Journey
```
Emotional Arc: Nostalgic UP → Reflective Mixed → Creative UP
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Preparation (grounding)                                 │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Remember (favorites, gratitude, peak moments - UP)      │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Connect (lessons, challenges, letting go - MIXED)       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Create (joy, vision, biggest win - UP)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Starts warm (memories), dips for processing, ends hopeful. More emotionally resonant.

### Sahil Bloom - The Energy Audit
```
Emotional Arc: Neutral → UP → DOWN → DOWN → UP → UP
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Q1: Changed Mind (neutral growth)                       │
│ Q2: Energy Creators (UP)                                │
│ Q3: Energy Drainers (DOWN)                              │
│ Q4: Boat Anchors (DOWN)                                 │
│ Q5: Fear Analysis (DOWN then UP via reframe)            │
│ Q6: Greatest Hits & Worst Misses (UP then DOWN)         │
│ Q7: Lessons Learned (UP - integration)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** True oscillation! Alternates energy states. Most sparkline-aligned.

### TK Kader - The Goal Machine
```
Emotional Arc: Grounding → Structured → Obstacle → Forward
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Check In (gratitude UP, stress DOWN, accomplishments UP)│
│    ↓                                                    │
│ 5 Goals (visioning - UP)                                │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Holding Back / Propelling Forward (confronting - DOWN)  │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Schedule & Execution (action - RESOLVED)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Goal-focused. Oscillates briefly in Check In, then drives forward.

### Ness Labs - The Category Sweep
```
Emotional Arc: Repetitive oscillation per category
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ For EACH of 9 categories:                               │
│   What went well? (UP)                                  │
│   What didn't? (DOWN)                                   │
│   Focus next year? (UP)                                 │
│ Summary: Accomplishments (UP), Challenges (DOWN),       │
│          Aspirations (UP), Commitment (RESOLVED)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Micro-oscillations within each category. Systematic but potentially repetitive.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR HENRY'S TEMPLATE

Given your stated preference for "meaning- and sense-making through rigorous reflection" with "a lot of narrative," the ideal flow should:
1. **Start with memory/warmth** (Tiago-style) to open the heart
2. **Oscillate between UP and DOWN** (Sahil-style) to create tension and resolution
3. **Ground in your Value Forest** (unique to you) as the integrating framework
4. **End with "New Bliss"** - transformed commitment to thriving

---

## Henry's Ethos Analysis

**Based on:** thrivinghenry.com writings, HAF Annual Review doc intro, Value Forest framework

### Core Identity Statement
**"To enable Thriving in myself and others"**

This purpose statement appears consistently across writings. Henry's work centers on:
- Self-improvement that serves a larger mission
- Systems thinking applied to personal growth
- Sharing frameworks generously (invitational mastery)

### Philosophical Pillars

**1. Thriving Over Achievement**
- Rejects "goals" framing as emotionally punitive (guilt, shame when missed)
- Prefers "outcomes and resolves" - warmer language
- Targets 60-70% completion rate intentionally (healthy OKR range)
- "Evaluation is not judgment"

**2. Systems Over Goals**
- Value Forest = living ecosystem, not checklist
- Every task traces back to purpose (no cognitive dissonance)
- Purpose → Vision → Goals hierarchy
- "Refinement" = doing less, better

**3. Invitational Mastery**
- Excellence serves its highest purpose when shared generously
- Leadership that "levels up others" without judgment
- Contrasts with "exclusionary excellence" that highlights gaps
- Creates "gentle, almost unnoticeable updraft on one's capacity"

**4. Authenticity Over Efficiency**
- Resists outsourcing his voice to AI
- Refuses "throw-away work"
- Questions whether actions align with values
- Genuine human expression over optimization

**5. Skepticism of Frameworks**
- Enneagram critique: "no clear understanding of how to work better"
- Values actionability over categorization
- Challenges unexamined assumptions
- "Is this MY thought or societal expectation?"

**6. Environmental Foundation**
- Physical environment shapes thriving
- Clean air, water, food as prerequisites
- Moved to Oregon deliberately
- Digital detox as ongoing practice

### Voice & Style

**Tone:** Philosophical yet practical. Opens with poetic imagery, grounds in concrete metrics.

**Language patterns:**
- "Thriving" (not success)
- "Value Trees" (not goals)
- "Outcomes and resolves" (not targets)
- "Refinement" (not optimization)

**Emotional register:** Genuine peace and gratitude, without toxic positivity. Acknowledges challenges while maintaining grounded hope.

### Key Quotes (for potential use in template)

> "Intentional starts result in more energy and commitment. Clear is kind. Especially with yourself."

> "I am closer to Thriving than ever before."

> "Evaluation is not judgment."

> "Where exclusionary excellence reminds you of the gap, invitational mastery chuckles at the concept of a gap."

---

## Henry's Worldview / Principles to Embed

**From HAF Annual Review 2023 Intro - Your Philosophy:**

> "Intentional starts result in more energy and commitment. Clear is kind. Especially with yourself."

> "This is my process and flow to ensure I'm resonant and aligned with MY life path (not what others or society expect of me)."

(Additional principles to be added as we finalize template)

---

## Henry's Template Preferences (From Review)

### From Tiago - What I Like

**Prep Section:**
- **Explicit space commitment** - Intentional externalized commitment. When we agree with ourselves and are practical by setting it in a calendar, it makes it much more likely to happen. (Grounded in neuroscience literature around intentionality). Henry takes 2-4 hours a day for a week.
- **Closing open loops** - David Allen's "open loops" or Henry's "niddly thoughts" - clearing the mental deck for a clean slate
- **Setting explicit boundaries** - Container and intention for the reflective session. Orients toward the direction you want to head.
- **"How do you want to feel at the end?"** - Somatic and emotional feel-state as or more important than practical tacticals
- **Hard commit timeline** - Explicit deadline (aligns with our vault closing concept)

**Remember Section:**
> "I LOVE starting with the remember section. It grounds everything in the awesome high points of the year. In doing that section I often find moments or patterns that yielded unexpected joy for me. This is arguably the most valuable because it surfaces things I wasn't aware of or didn't expect that I can lean into more for next year."

**Connect Section:**
- Takes free-floating observations and pulls them down to practical tactical observations about what worked and what didn't

**Create Section:**
- Ending on Create is fine, but not everyone wants to create
- For our purposes: more about what do you want to accomplish and how do you want to BE in each of the value trees

---

### From Gustin - What I Like

**Opening:**
- No-BS letter that says this is intense, but worth it
- Starting with explicit and rigorous housekeeping
- Including tidbits about how Gustin does it himself - makes it feel very real and tangible

**Reflect Section:**
- Similar aspirational/memory first framing as Tiago's

**Outcomes Review:**
- Love the concept, BUT only works if you track projects/outcomes rigorously
- **Key insight: Need flexibility for opt-in/opt-out sections**
  - Primer questions like "Did you set explicit goals or outcomes for last year?" determine if we go granular project-by-project or high-level
- "Is this still important?" - Critical for removing things that no longer matter/serve

**Day/Week Audit:**
- Want to like it, but historically least useful because days aren't always structured
- **Fix:** Ground in specifics from last few weeks/month (historical look-back, not hypothetical)
- Example: "Look at your Calendar for the last 4-8 weeks. How do you allocate your work days? Your off-work days?"

**Automate/Delegate/Eliminate:**
- Want to love it, but historically clunky
- **Better approach:** Chain from "What tasks/things have most bothered/annoyed/frustrated you?" → These become candidates for improvement/automation/handoff
- Note: Many of these can now be offloaded to Claude skills!

**Habits:**
- Love the focus on habits - definitely want to add and explore
- **Philosophical framing:**
> "The footfall of wolves shapes the rivers they run by."
- Captures power of consistent, repeated behaviors that compound to radically change environments and ecosystems. Larger than just "habits."

**Themes & Goals:**
- Like themes (parallel to Value Forest)
- Hate concept of "goals" but find tremendous value in aspirational planning
- Like crazy stretch goals - gives license to dream big for a moment
- Consider: "Golden screen" meditation or "meet yourself when you're 80" meditation as equivalent approaches for big picture dream state without corporate-y "BHAG" framing

**Gut Check:**
- Something powerful about "is this even realistic" once all goals are set
- Want to incorporate this at tail end of flow

---

### Overall Design Principles (From Henry)

**Tone:**
- NOT corporate-y, OKR-y, or QBR-like
- Tiago's feels very human (preferred) vs. Gustin's feels like a QBR
- Real, tangible, personal

**Completeness:**
> "By the time I'm done with my template, I want to feel like I've left no stone unturned in examining myself - where I did well, and where I can improve."

**Outcome:**
- Walk away with clarity AND an action plan for the following year
- Final write-up feeds into quarterly reviews: "At the annual review you mentioned these priorities - how are those going?"

---

### Key Concepts to Incorporate

1. **Closing open loops / niddly thoughts** (prep)
2. **Somatic feel-state questions** (throughout)
3. **Opt-in/opt-out flexibility** with primer questions
4. **Ground in specifics** - calendar/photos/actual data, not memory
5. **Wolves/rivers metaphor** for habits
6. **Dream-state exercises** without corporate framing
7. **Realism gut-check** at the end
8. **Quarterly review feed-forward** capability

---

## Cherry-Picked Questions (Candidates)

### From Tiago
- [ ] "How do you want to feel at the end of this review?"
- [ ] Calendar/photo/notes review as grounding exercises
- [ ] "What stories from last year are you letting go of?"

### From Gustin
- [ ] "Is this goal/outcome still important to you?"
- [ ] "Do you literally have enough time to achieve the goals you set?"
- [ ] Day/week audit (grounded in actual calendar data)

### From Sahil Bloom
- [ ] (To be added after review)

### From TK Kader
- [ ] (To be added after review)

### Original / Henry's Own
- [ ] Wolves/rivers habit framing
- [ ] Value Forest integration questions
- [ ] "Niddly thoughts" closing exercise
- [ ] Dream-state visualization (non-corporate BHAG alternative)

---

## Questions to Cut / Avoid

- Anything that feels corporate/OKR-like
- "Goals" language (use outcomes/resolves/aspirations instead)
- Generic time-based scheduling that doesn't ground in actual calendar
- Create-focused endings (not everyone wants to create)

---

## Open Questions

- ~~Target length? (questions, minutes)~~ → Comprehensive like Gustin (2-3 hours spread over multiple sessions)
- ~~Tone?~~ → Human like Tiago, not QBR like Gustin
- Unique angle? What makes someone choose this over Sahil's or TK's?
  - → Value Forest integration
  - → Opt-in/opt-out flexibility
  - → Feeds into quarterly reviews
  - → No-stone-unturned completeness

---

### From TK Kader - What I Like

**Content & Resources:**
- Deeper dive resources and videos (makes sense for his content-heavy approach)
- **Future feature:** Nicely produced content to speak to different sections/intro - v2 or v3 thing

**Format:**
- Each section is short, sweet, and to the point
- **Downside:** Super prescriptive - doesn't feel like room for serendipity or emergence

**Key Questions:**
- LOVE "How will I feel when I accomplish this?" - aspirational planning feels
- LOVE "Who can help me?" - similar to Gustin's approach
- **Net new vs. progressing** - highlighting projects with activation energy vs. accelerating existing work
- "How has this been solved before?" and "Who can help me?"
- **Future feature:** Could integrate with LinkedIn/network for the "who can help" step

**Planning & Check-ins:**
- Rigorous planning structure (hyper-scheduling vs. not scheduling - both have value when done intentionally)
- Want to keep open to people's preferences and style
- Recurring check-ins (Henry does quarterly) - feeds into quarterly reviews

---

### From Sahil Bloom - What I Like

**Changed Mind:**
- LOVE "Where did I change my mind?" - anchors in reflection and questioning deeply held beliefs
- Primes intellectual nimbleness in a graceful way
- Tiago asked something similar

**Feynman's 12 Questions:**
- This reminds of Feynman's famous 12 questions framing
- LOVE that approach from Tiago's cohort
- 12 may be too many for average user, but 3-6 big questions could fit naturally

**Energy Audit:**
- Cool concept
- **Interesting variation:** Overlay with wheel of the year coloring - zoom out from daily/weekly to natural/seasonal cycles
- Calendar-based + seasonal view

**Energy Drainers:**
- People/things that drain energy consistent across all templates - keep this

**Fear:**
- Calling out fear explicitly is powerful
- Feels more spiritual/human than business-y

**What I Learned:**
- "What did I learn this year?" is powerful
- Henry loves doing this on birthday ("XX lessons from my YZ year") - partially because birthday is in annual review cycle
- **Future feature:** Add "lessons learned on birthday" type review template to TBD
- **For this template:** Add a lessons learned question in flow

---

### From Ness Labs - What I Like

**Cognitive Load:**
- Reduces cognitive load SIGNIFICANTLY with simple walled-garden approach
- *Feels* comprehensive without the weight/time of Gustin style

**Reality Check:**
> "In truth, having done both, this version is surprisingly flat and limited in what I got out of it, but it doesn't feel like that on the face of it - which is very interesting."

**Format:**
- Simple, intuitive start/stop/continue format for each category
- Repetitive nature lulls you into a groove (for better and worse)

**Downside:**
- Very little "unexpected" or emergence - very straightahead

---

### From Chris Guillebeau - What I Like

**Strengths:**
- Presumes quarterly reviews and specific actionable projects/KPIs

**Downside:**
- Not all things (and for most people, most things) have explicit metrics
- Don't want to force business-y approach onto folks who would benefit from reflection but don't want to stack out life OKRs

---

### From Mattias Frank - What I Like

- Nothing particularly new/clever relative to others
- Like the framing of "What I learned from..."

---

### From MashaPlans - What I Like

**New Things / Skills:**
- Like callout on new things tried/learned/skills gained
- Could be something proud of, or something small/trivial that still makes you smile
- **"Something that made you smile..."** - very low-key way of finding unexpected moments of joy

**Retrospective:**
- One word retrospective (distinct from setting intention/mantra for next year)
- "What were new habits?" and "What changed in you?"

**Revealed Preferences:**
- "What did you get rid of?" and "What did you forget about?"
- Surfaces revealed preferences - what emerged as important vs. what you thought cognitively
- Distinct from overlaid beliefs about your experience

**Entertainment/Rest:**
- Curious section - entertainment usually throwaway unless deeply stuck (top read/thought/watched)
- **"How did I have rest?"** - particularly effective question
- What exactly qualifies as effective rest?

**Relationships:**
- Would fit naturally in Value Trees

**Best of the Year:**
- Great framing, aligned with retrospective at top of Gustin and Tiago

**Extras:**
- Good for general question bank

**Overall Feel:**
> "I liked the 'feminine' feel of these questions. Less hard driving and business-y in a warm and welcoming way."

---

## Final Structure

### Design Analysis: Core Tensions Navigated

**1. Comprehensive vs. Emergent**
- Want "no stone unturned" depth (Gustin-style)
- But also value serendipity, unexpected discoveries, emergence
- Ness Labs felt "surprisingly flat" despite feeling comprehensive
- TK felt "too prescriptive" with no room for emergence
- **Solution:** Structure creates containers for depth, but with open-ended prompts that allow unexpected insights. Not just "rate 1-10" but "what surprised you?"

**2. Human vs. Business-y**
- Strong aversion to OKRs, QBRs, corporate framing, "goals" language
- Loved MashaPlans' "feminine" feel - warm, welcoming
- Want spiritual/human framing (fear, rest, joy) over metrics
- Yet still want actionable outcomes and quarterly review feed-forward
- **Solution:** Frame everything in human terms (thriving, outcomes, resolves) but still extract practical commitments. The wolf shapes the river - not "set KPIs."

**3. Grounded in Data vs. Open to Feeling**
- Love grounding in specifics: actual calendar, photos, real data from last 4-8 weeks
- But equally value somatic/emotional questions: "How do you want to feel?"
- Revealed preferences (what you actually did) vs. cognitive beliefs (what you think you should do)
- **Solution:** Alternate between data-grounded and feeling-oriented questions. Use one to inform the other.

**4. Intentional Prep vs. Just Dive In**
- Strong emphasis on prep: closing open loops, setting container, explicit time commitment
- Neuroscience-backed intentionality matters
- **Solution:** Prep section is foundational, almost ritualistic - not optional housekeeping.

---

### What Lights Henry Up (Pattern Recognition)

1. **Memory-first approach** - "Arguably the most valuable because it surfaces things I wasn't aware of."
2. **Intellectual nimbleness** - "Where did I change my mind?" primes questioning beliefs gracefully
3. **Practical wisdom over theory** - "Who has solved this before? Who can help?"
4. **Small joys, not just big wins** - "Something that made you smile" alongside accomplishments
5. **Revealed preferences** - What you actually did/forgot matters more than what you thought you valued
6. **Rest as a category** - Explicitly examining what qualifies as effective rest
7. **Big questions** - Feynman's 12, dream-state visualizations, "meet yourself at 80"

---

### Three Emotional Registers (Use Throughout)

Every major section should touch all three:
1. **Data/Memory** - What actually happened (calendar, photos, revealed preferences)
2. **Feeling/Somatic** - How did it feel? How do you want to feel?
3. **Wisdom/Integration** - What does this mean? What did you learn?

### Key Refinement: Value Forest Integration

Moved "Who has done this before? Who can help?" and "Net new vs. progressing" INTO the Value Forest section as natural extensions of each tree's aspiration. This creates a complete arc per tree:
1. Celebrate (proud, grateful)
2. Acknowledge (fears, blockers)
3. Aspire (what I want + who can help + is it new or continuing)
4. Validate (is this still important?)

The "Ground It" section then becomes a ROLL-UP forcing prioritization across all the trees - which is extremely valuable for preventing over-commitment.

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Fill in specific questions for each section (pull from question bank)
2. [ ] Define opt-in/opt-out branching logic (primer questions)
3. [ ] Write Henry's intro letter
4. [ ] Determine Value Forest handling (use existing? create during review? skip?)
5. [ ] Build TypeScript template file
