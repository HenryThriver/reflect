### Chris Guillebeau (not a template - thought process)
**Source:** https://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review

**Core Framework:**
- Two foundational questions: "What went well?" and "What did not go well?"
- Generate 6-8 answers to each
- Only include outcomes you could actually influence (controllability principle)
- ~70-80% goal achievement is healthy (means you're being ambitious enough)

**Process:**
- Review previous year's goals in "Final Review" column
- Assess achievement level + understand why
- Category-based goal setting (Writing, Business, Health, Travel, Financial)
- 3-5 measurable goals per category
- "Required actions" column identifying necessary steps
- Year theme statement

**Key insight:** Simplicity + controllability + honesty

## Draft Architecture: Henry's Annual Review Template

### Design Principles
1. **Sparkline-informed** - Oscillate between "what is" (DOWN) and "what could be" (UP)
2. **Value Forest integrated** - Review centered on your 18 Value Trees
3. **Comprehensive** - Err on side of thorough (Gustin-style depth)
4. **Emotionally resonant** - Open warmly, process deeply, end with transformed commitment
5. **Language aligned** - Thriving, outcomes, resolves (not goals, success, targets)

### Proposed Flow (with Sparkline Mapping)

```
SECTION                          | ENERGY | SPARKLINE
─────────────────────────────────┼────────┼──────────

6. Synthesize: What's Draining   | DOWN ↓ | What Is
7. Value Forest Review           | MIXED  | Oscillating

### Mattias Frank (from HAF doc)
**Source:** https://matthiasfrank.notion.site/

**Unique Framework:** 2x2 grid (Past/Future × Introspection/Action)
- Past + Introspection = Reflect
- Past + Action = Learn from it
- Future + Introspection = Envision
- Future + Action = Plan

**Key Philosophy:**
- "The unexamined life is not worth living" - Sokrates
- "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate" - Jung
- Combats the "end-of-history illusion" - assumption that who you are now is who you'll remain

## Duarte Sparkline Analysis

**Source:** Nancy Duarte's "Resonate" framework ([TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks), [Duarte blog](https://www.duarte.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-contrast/))

### The Core Concept

The Sparkline is a visual representation of how great speeches and presentations alternate between two states:
- **"What Is"** (lower line) - The current reality, status quo, challenges, problems
- **"What Could Be"** (upper line) - The vision, possibility, aspiration, transformation

### How It Works

1. **Contrast creates tension** - The gap between "what is" and "what could be" should be as large as possible
2. **Oscillation maintains engagement** - You "tack" back and forth like a sailboat, not one straight line up
3. **The journey ends at "New Bliss"** - The transformed state where the audience has been persuaded to join you

### Visual Shape
```
          ╱╲      ╱╲      ╱╲   → NEW BLISS
"What    ╱  ╲    ╱  ╲    ╱  ╲  /
Could   ╱    ╲  ╱    ╲  ╱    ╲/
 Be"   ╱      ╲╱      ╲╱
      ↗
START  "What Is" (current reality)
      ────────────────────────→ TIME
```

### Famous Examples
- **MLK "I Have a Dream"**: Alternates between the harsh reality of segregation ("what is") and the vision of equality ("what could be")
- **Steve Jobs iPhone launch**: Current phone problems → revolutionary solution, repeated throughout

### Application to Annual Reviews

**Key Insight:** An annual review can follow this same emotional arc:
- "What Is" = Current state, challenges, energy drains, fears, misses
- "What Could Be" = Aspirations, transformed self, values alignment, thriving

**The oscillation could map to:**
1. Remember the highs (UP) → Acknowledge the lows (DOWN)
2. See current gaps (DOWN) → Envision ideal state (UP)
3. Face fears/obstacles (DOWN) → Commit to transformation (UP)
4. End at "New Bliss" = Clear vision for year ahead

## Template Flow Analysis (Emotional Sparklines)

### Gustin - The Comprehensive Audit
```
Emotional Arc: Neutral → Down → Mixed → Up → Resolved
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Housekeeping (neutral clean slate)                      │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Reflect (mixed - highs AND lows together)               │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Review Outcomes (potentially down - missed goals)       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Where You Are Now (confronting gaps - DOWN)             │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ What Do You Want (visioning - UP)                       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Action & Plan (grounded commitment - RESOLVED)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Linear progression, not oscillating. Front-loads reflection before vision.

### Tiago - The Memory Journey
```
Emotional Arc: Nostalgic UP → Reflective Mixed → Creative UP
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Preparation (grounding)                                 │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Remember (favorites, gratitude, peak moments - UP)      │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Connect (lessons, challenges, letting go - MIXED)       │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Create (joy, vision, biggest win - UP)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Starts warm (memories), dips for processing, ends hopeful. More emotionally resonant.

### Sahil Bloom - The Energy Audit
```
Emotional Arc: Neutral → UP → DOWN → DOWN → UP → UP
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Q1: Changed Mind (neutral growth)                       │
│ Q2: Energy Creators (UP)                                │
│ Q3: Energy Drainers (DOWN)                              │
│ Q4: Boat Anchors (DOWN)                                 │
│ Q5: Fear Analysis (DOWN then UP via reframe)            │
│ Q6: Greatest Hits & Worst Misses (UP then DOWN)         │
│ Q7: Lessons Learned (UP - integration)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** True oscillation! Alternates energy states. Most sparkline-aligned.

### TK Kader - The Goal Machine
```
Emotional Arc: Grounding → Structured → Obstacle → Forward
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Check In (gratitude UP, stress DOWN, accomplishments UP)│
│    ↓                                                    │
│ 5 Goals (visioning - UP)                                │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Holding Back / Propelling Forward (confronting - DOWN)  │
│    ↓                                                    │
│ Schedule & Execution (action - RESOLVED)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Goal-focused. Oscillates briefly in Check In, then drives forward.

### Ness Labs - The Category Sweep
```
Emotional Arc: Repetitive oscillation per category
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ For EACH of 9 categories:                               │
│   What went well? (UP)                                  │
│   What didn't? (DOWN)                                   │
│   Focus next year? (UP)                                 │
│ Summary: Accomplishments (UP), Challenges (DOWN),       │
│          Aspirations (UP), Commitment (RESOLVED)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Verdict:** Micro-oscillations within each category. Systematic but potentially repetitive.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR HENRY'S TEMPLATE

Given your stated preference for "meaning- and sense-making through rigorous reflection" with "a lot of narrative," the ideal flow should:
1. **Start with memory/warmth** (Tiago-style) to open the heart
2. **Oscillate between UP and DOWN** (Sahil-style) to create tension and resolution
3. **Ground in your Value Forest** (unique to you) as the integrating framework
4. **End with "New Bliss"** - transformed commitment to thriving

---

## Henry's Ethos Analysis

**Based on:** thrivinghenry.com writings, HAF Annual Review doc intro, Value Forest framework

### Core Identity Statement
**"To enable Thriving in myself and others"**

This purpose statement appears consistently across writings. Henry's work centers on:
- Self-improvement that serves a larger mission
- Systems thinking applied to personal growth
- Sharing frameworks generously (invitational mastery)

### Philosophical Pillars

**1. Thriving Over Achievement**
- Rejects "goals" framing as emotionally punitive (guilt, shame when missed)
- Prefers "outcomes and resolves" - warmer language
- Targets 60-70% completion rate intentionally (healthy OKR range)
- "Evaluation is not judgment"

**2. Systems Over Goals**
- Value Forest = living ecosystem, not checklist
- Every task traces back to purpose (no cognitive dissonance)
- Purpose → Vision → Goals hierarchy
- "Refinement" = doing less, better

**3. Invitational Mastery**
- Excellence serves its highest purpose when shared generously
- Leadership that "levels up others" without judgment
- Contrasts with "exclusionary excellence" that highlights gaps
- Creates "gentle, almost unnoticeable updraft on one's capacity"

**4. Authenticity Over Efficiency**
- Resists outsourcing his voice to AI
- Refuses "throw-away work"
- Questions whether actions align with values
- Genuine human expression over optimization

**5. Skepticism of Frameworks**
- Enneagram critique: "no clear understanding of how to work better"
- Values actionability over categorization
- Challenges unexamined assumptions
- "Is this MY thought or societal expectation?"

**6. Environmental Foundation**
- Physical environment shapes thriving
- Clean air, water, food as prerequisites
- Moved to Oregon deliberately
- Digital detox as ongoing practice

### Voice & Style

**Tone:** Philosophical yet practical. Opens with poetic imagery, grounds in concrete metrics.

**Language patterns:**
- "Thriving" (not success)
- "Value Trees" (not goals)
- "Outcomes and resolves" (not targets)
- "Refinement" (not optimization)

**Emotional register:** Genuine peace and gratitude, without toxic positivity. Acknowledges challenges while maintaining grounded hope.

### Key Quotes (for potential use in template)

> "Intentional starts result in more energy and commitment. Clear is kind. Especially with yourself."

> "I am closer to Thriving than ever before."

> "Evaluation is not judgment."

> "Where exclusionary excellence reminds you of the gap, invitational mastery chuckles at the concept of a gap."

---

## Henry's Worldview / Principles to Embed

**From HAF Annual Review 2023 Intro - Your Philosophy:**

> "Intentional starts result in more energy and commitment. Clear is kind. Especially with yourself."

> "This is my process and flow to ensure I'm resonant and aligned with MY life path (not what others or society expect of me)."

(Additional principles to be added as we finalize template)

---

## Henry's Template Preferences (From Review)

### From Tiago - What I Like

**Prep Section:**
- **Explicit space commitment** - Intentional externalized commitment. When we agree with ourselves and are practical by setting it in a calendar, it makes it much more likely to happen. (Grounded in neuroscience literature around intentionality). Henry takes 2-4 hours a day for a week.
- **Closing open loops** - David Allen's "open loops" or Henry's "niddly thoughts" - clearing the mental deck for a clean slate
- **Setting explicit boundaries** - Container and intention for the reflective session. Orients toward the direction you want to head.
- **"How do you want to feel at the end?"** - Somatic and emotional feel-state as or more important than practical tacticals
- **Hard commit timeline** - Explicit deadline (aligns with our vault closing concept)

**Remember Section:**
> "I LOVE starting with the remember section. It grounds everything in the awesome high points of the year. In doing that section I often find moments or patterns that yielded unexpected joy for me. This is arguably the most valuable because it surfaces things I wasn't aware of or didn't expect that I can lean into more for next year."

**Connect Section:**
- Takes free-floating observations and pulls them down to practical tactical observations about what worked and what didn't

**Create Section:**
- Ending on Create is fine, but not everyone wants to create
- For our purposes: more about what do you want to accomplish and how do you want to BE in each of the value trees

---

### From Gustin - What I Like

**Opening:**
- No-BS letter that says this is intense, but worth it
- Starting with explicit and rigorous housekeeping
- Including tidbits about how Gustin does it himself - makes it feel very real and tangible

**Reflect Section:**
- Similar aspirational/memory first framing as Tiago's

**Outcomes Review:**
- Love the concept, BUT only works if you track projects/outcomes rigorously
- **Key insight: Need flexibility for opt-in/opt-out sections**
  - Primer questions like "Did you set explicit goals or outcomes for last year?" determine if we go granular project-by-project or high-level
- "Is this still important?" - Critical for removing things that no longer matter/serve

**Day/Week Audit:**
- Want to like it, but historically least useful because days aren't always structured
- **Fix:** Ground in specifics from last few weeks/month (historical look-back, not hypothetical)
- Example: "Look at your Calendar for the last 4-8 weeks. How do you allocate your work days? Your off-work days?"

**Automate/Delegate/Eliminate:**
- Want to love it, but historically clunky
- **Better approach:** Chain from "What tasks/things have most bothered/annoyed/frustrated you?" → These become candidates for improvement/automation/handoff
- Note: Many of these can now be offloaded to Claude skills!

**Habits:**
- Love the focus on habits - definitely want to add and explore
- **Philosophical framing:**
> "The footfall of wolves shapes the rivers they run by."
- Captures power of consistent, repeated behaviors that compound to radically change environments and ecosystems. Larger than just "habits."

**Themes & Goals:**
- Like themes (parallel to Value Forest)
- Hate concept of "goals" but find tremendous value in aspirational planning
- Like crazy stretch goals - gives license to dream big for a moment
- Consider: "Golden screen" meditation or "meet yourself when you're 80" meditation as equivalent approaches for big picture dream state without corporate-y "BHAG" framing

**Gut Check:**
- Something powerful about "is this even realistic" once all goals are set
- Want to incorporate this at tail end of flow

---

### Overall Design Principles (From Henry)

**Tone:**
- NOT corporate-y, OKR-y, or QBR-like
- Tiago's feels very human (preferred) vs. Gustin's feels like a QBR
- Real, tangible, personal

**Completeness:**
> "By the time I'm done with my template, I want to feel like I've left no stone unturned in examining myself - where I did well, and where I can improve."

**Outcome:**
- Walk away with clarity AND an action plan for the following year
- Final write-up feeds into quarterly reviews: "At the annual review you mentioned these priorities - how are those going?"

---

### Key Concepts to Incorporate

1. **Closing open loops / niddly thoughts** (prep)
2. **Somatic feel-state questions** (throughout)
3. **Opt-in/opt-out flexibility** with primer questions
4. **Ground in specifics** - calendar/photos/actual data, not memory
5. **Wolves/rivers metaphor** for habits
6. **Dream-state exercises** without corporate framing
7. **Realism gut-check** at the end
8. **Quarterly review feed-forward** capability

---

## Cherry-Picked Questions (Candidates)

### From Tiago
- [ ] "How do you want to feel at the end of this review?"
- [ ] Calendar/photo/notes review as grounding exercises
- [ ] "What stories from last year are you letting go of?"

### From Gustin
- [ ] "Is this goal/outcome still important to you?"
- [ ] "Do you literally have enough time to achieve the goals you set?"
- [ ] Day/week audit (grounded in actual calendar data)

### From Sahil Bloom
- [ ] (To be added after review)

### From TK Kader
- [ ] (To be added after review)

### Original / Henry's Own
- [ ] Wolves/rivers habit framing
- [ ] Value Forest integration questions
- [ ] "Niddly thoughts" closing exercise
- [ ] Dream-state visualization (non-corporate BHAG alternative)

---

## Questions to Cut / Avoid

- Anything that feels corporate/OKR-like
- "Goals" language (use outcomes/resolves/aspirations instead)
- Generic time-based scheduling that doesn't ground in actual calendar
- Create-focused endings (not everyone wants to create)

---

## Open Questions

- ~~Target length? (questions, minutes)~~ → Comprehensive like Gustin (2-3 hours spread over multiple sessions)
- ~~Tone?~~ → Human like Tiago, not QBR like Gustin
- Unique angle? What makes someone choose this over Sahil's or TK's?
  - → Value Forest integration
  - → Opt-in/opt-out flexibility
  - → Feeds into quarterly reviews
  - → No-stone-unturned completeness

---

### From TK Kader - What I Like

**Content & Resources:**
- Deeper dive resources and videos (makes sense for his content-heavy approach)
- **Future feature:** Nicely produced content to speak to different sections/intro - v2 or v3 thing

**Format:**
- Each section is short, sweet, and to the point
- **Downside:** Super prescriptive - doesn't feel like room for serendipity or emergence

**Key Questions:**
- LOVE "How will I feel when I accomplish this?" - aspirational planning feels
- LOVE "Who can help me?" - similar to Gustin's approach
- **Net new vs. progressing** - highlighting projects with activation energy vs. accelerating existing work
- "How has this been solved before?" and "Who can help me?"
- **Future feature:** Could integrate with LinkedIn/network for the "who can help" step

**Planning & Check-ins:**
- Rigorous planning structure (hyper-scheduling vs. not scheduling - both have value when done intentionally)
- Want to keep open to people's preferences and style
- Recurring check-ins (Henry does quarterly) - feeds into quarterly reviews

---

### From Sahil Bloom - What I Like

**Changed Mind:**
- LOVE "Where did I change my mind?" - anchors in reflection and questioning deeply held beliefs
- Primes intellectual nimbleness in a graceful way
- Tiago asked something similar

**Feynman's 12 Questions:**
- This reminds of Feynman's famous 12 questions framing
- LOVE that approach from Tiago's cohort
- 12 may be too many for average user, but 3-6 big questions could fit naturally

**Energy Audit:**
- Cool concept
- **Interesting variation:** Overlay with wheel of the year coloring - zoom out from daily/weekly to natural/seasonal cycles
- Calendar-based + seasonal view

**Energy Drainers:**
- People/things that drain energy consistent across all templates - keep this

**Fear:**
- Calling out fear explicitly is powerful
- Feels more spiritual/human than business-y

**What I Learned:**
- "What did I learn this year?" is powerful
- Henry loves doing this on birthday ("XX lessons from my YZ year") - partially because birthday is in annual review cycle
- **Future feature:** Add "lessons learned on birthday" type review template to TBD
- **For this template:** Add a lessons learned question in flow

---

### From Ness Labs - What I Like

**Cognitive Load:**
- Reduces cognitive load SIGNIFICANTLY with simple walled-garden approach
- *Feels* comprehensive without the weight/time of Gustin style

**Reality Check:**
> "In truth, having done both, this version is surprisingly flat and limited in what I got out of it, but it doesn't feel like that on the face of it - which is very interesting."

**Format:**
- Simple, intuitive start/stop/continue format for each category
- Repetitive nature lulls you into a groove (for better and worse)

**Downside:**
- Very little "unexpected" or emergence - very straightahead

---

### From Chris Guillebeau - What I Like

**Strengths:**
- Presumes quarterly reviews and specific actionable projects/KPIs

**Downside:**
- Not all things (and for most people, most things) have explicit metrics
- Don't want to force business-y approach onto folks who would benefit from reflection but don't want to stack out life OKRs

---

### From Mattias Frank - What I Like

- Nothing particularly new/clever relative to others
- Like the framing of "What I learned from..."

---

### From MashaPlans - What I Like

**New Things / Skills:**
- Like callout on new things tried/learned/skills gained
- Could be something proud of, or something small/trivial that still makes you smile
- **"Something that made you smile..."** - very low-key way of finding unexpected moments of joy

**Retrospective:**
- One word retrospective (distinct from setting intention/mantra for next year)
- "What were new habits?" and "What changed in you?"

**Revealed Preferences:**
- "What did you get rid of?" and "What did you forget about?"
- Surfaces revealed preferences - what emerged as important vs. what you thought cognitively
- Distinct from overlaid beliefs about your experience

**Entertainment/Rest:**
- Curious section - entertainment usually throwaway unless deeply stuck (top read/thought/watched)
- **"How did I have rest?"** - particularly effective question
- What exactly qualifies as effective rest?

**Relationships:**
- Would fit naturally in Value Trees

**Best of the Year:**
- Great framing, aligned with retrospective at top of Gustin and Tiago

**Extras:**
- Good for general question bank

**Overall Feel:**
> "I liked the 'feminine' feel of these questions. Less hard driving and business-y in a warm and welcoming way."

---

## Final Structure

### Design Analysis: Core Tensions Navigated

**1. Comprehensive vs. Emergent**
- Want "no stone unturned" depth (Gustin-style)
- But also value serendipity, unexpected discoveries, emergence
- Ness Labs felt "surprisingly flat" despite feeling comprehensive
- TK felt "too prescriptive" with no room for emergence
- **Solution:** Structure creates containers for depth, but with open-ended prompts that allow unexpected insights. Not just "rate 1-10" but "what surprised you?"

**2. Human vs. Business-y**
- Strong aversion to OKRs, QBRs, corporate framing, "goals" language
- Loved MashaPlans' "feminine" feel - warm, welcoming
- Want spiritual/human framing (fear, rest, joy) over metrics
- Yet still want actionable outcomes and quarterly review feed-forward
- **Solution:** Frame everything in human terms (thriving, outcomes, resolves) but still extract practical commitments. The wolf shapes the river - not "set KPIs."

**3. Grounded in Data vs. Open to Feeling**
- Love grounding in specifics: actual calendar, photos, real data from last 4-8 weeks
- But equally value somatic/emotional questions: "How do you want to feel?"
- Revealed preferences (what you actually did) vs. cognitive beliefs (what you think you should do)
- **Solution:** Alternate between data-grounded and feeling-oriented questions. Use one to inform the other.

**4. Intentional Prep vs. Just Dive In**
- Strong emphasis on prep: closing open loops, setting container, explicit time commitment
- Neuroscience-backed intentionality matters
- **Solution:** Prep section is foundational, almost ritualistic - not optional housekeeping.

---

### What Lights Henry Up (Pattern Recognition)

1. **Memory-first approach** - "Arguably the most valuable because it surfaces things I wasn't aware of."
2. **Intellectual nimbleness** - "Where did I change my mind?" primes questioning beliefs gracefully
3. **Practical wisdom over theory** - "Who has solved this before? Who can help?"
4. **Small joys, not just big wins** - "Something that made you smile" alongside accomplishments
5. **Revealed preferences** - What you actually did/forgot matters more than what you thought you valued
6. **Rest as a category** - Explicitly examining what qualifies as effective rest
7. **Big questions** - Feynman's 12, dream-state visualizations, "meet yourself at 80"

---

### Three Emotional Registers (Use Throughout)

Every major section should touch all three:
1. **Data/Memory** - What actually happened (calendar, photos, revealed preferences)
2. **Feeling/Somatic** - How did it feel? How do you want to feel?
3. **Wisdom/Integration** - What does this mean? What did you learn?

### Key Refinement: Value Forest Integration

Moved "Who has done this before? Who can help?" and "Net new vs. progressing" INTO the Value Forest section as natural extensions of each tree's aspiration. This creates a complete arc per tree:
1. Celebrate (proud, grateful)
2. Acknowledge (fears, blockers)
3. Aspire (what I want + who can help + is it new or continuing)
4. Validate (is this still important?)

The "Ground It" section then becomes a ROLL-UP forcing prioritization across all the trees - which is extremely valuable for preventing over-commitment.

### Next Steps

1. [x] Fill in specific questions for each section (pull from question bank)
2. [ ] Define opt-in/opt-out branching logic (primer questions)
3. [ ] Write Henry's intro letter
4. [ ] Determine Value Forest handling (use existing? create during review? skip?)
5. [ ] Build TypeScript template file

#### 1A. Henry's Intro Letter (Placeholder - to refine)

> **Welcome to my Annual Review process!** 🎉
>
> To those of you who don't know me: I've done extensive annual reviews going on 4+ years now and it is one of the most meaningful and productive weeks of my life. I synthesize frameworks from multiple sources and integrate that with my worldview on Life, Values, and Thriving.
>
> I appreciate this process may seem intense, even too much. The purpose for me is to genuinely consider, with fresh eyes, every aspect of my life and whether I am living the values and qualities aligned with my life mission. It is mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive. Take what serves you and leave the rest.
>
> Or, perhaps this is the year you feel inspired to push yourself beyond the constraints of what feels easy, fun, or comfortable. Perhaps this year you also want to challenge everything and leave no stone unturned. Perhaps this year you'll take a fresh look and feel at peace with a fresh start.
>
> **Intentional starts result in more energy and commitment. Clear is kind. Especially with yourself.**
>
> This is my process and flow to ensure I'm resonant and aligned with MY life path (not what others or society expect of me).
>
> I hope that you enjoy this process and find it useful for your own path to Thriving.
>
> — Henry

#### 1B. Clear Your Space

**Section intro:**
> Before we dive deep, let's clear the decks. The clearer your mental and practical space, the stronger your signal will be. This isn't busywork—it's creating the conditions for genuine insight.
>
> I personally chip away at this daily for a week or so before my review. Don't try to do this all in one sitting if it feels overwhelming.

**Interactive Checklist (checkboxes, skippable):**

| # | Task | Type |
|---|------|------|
| 1B.1 | **Brain dump** - Write down anything free-floating or taking up mental space. Keep writing until you have 60 seconds where nothing new comes to mind. Clear your mind. | checkbox |
| 1B.2 | **Clear your task list** - Process or park any open items in your to-do/project management system so they're not nagging at you | checkbox |
| 1B.3 | **Clear your inbox** - Triage, archive, or declare email bankruptcy. Zero or close to it. | checkbox |
| 1B.4 | **Clear your desktop** - Digital clutter creates mental clutter | checkbox |
| 1B.5 | **Clear your downloads folder** - Yes, that too | checkbox |
| 1B.6 | **Clear your physical space** - Clean your desk, or better yet, go somewhere entirely new and different | checkbox |

**Completion prompt:**
> When you've cleared all the things (or enough of them), continue.

---

#### 1C. Create Your Container

**Section intro:**
> Now let's make this special. This is sacred time you're giving yourself—treat it that way.

**Ritual invitations (choose your own adventure):**

- Make your favorite cup of coffee or tea
- Light a candle
- Put your phone in another room (or airplane mode, at minimum)
- Pick a warm, comfortable place—your favorite chair, a coffee shop that feels like home
- Take a few deep breaths. If you'd like, try square breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat 3-4 times.

**Henry's approach:**
> For me, I've found going outside to somewhere I don't usually work, or to my local coffee shop with super comfy chairs, is what works best. Change of scenery gives me just enough "different" that I gain a new perspective. I also recommend eating a moderately sized high-protein, high-fat meal before (or fast if you're experienced) so your brain works well and your blood sugar is stable.

**A note on handwriting:**
> I encourage you to work through this entire review by hand first—pen and paper. There's something about handwriting that slows down thought and deepens reflection. The first answer in your head to these questions is usually the right one.
>
> If you choose this path, use this tool to capture your handwritten answers afterward. Every question is optional, so you can click through at your own pace as you transfer your responses.

>
> Take one more breath. When you're ready to begin, step through.

5E. Overview / Satisfaction Snapshot
```

---

#### 5A. Section Intro

> Now we turn to the heart of your life—the different areas that make up who you are and how you spend your time.
>
> I use a framework I call the "Value Forest"—a collection of Value Trees, each representing an important area of life. Each tree has roots (your purpose), a trunk (your values), branches (your outcomes), and leaves (your projects).
>
> In this section, you'll select which life areas are relevant to you right now, reflect deeply on each one, and then prioritize them. Not every tree will apply to everyone—that's the point. Choose the ones that matter to you.

**Henry's approach:**
> I have 18 Value Trees, but for most people 8-10 is plenty. The categories below cover the major life domains. If something doesn't fit neatly, that might be a sign you need to create your own custom tree—but for now, work with what resonates.

---

#### 5B. Select Your Value Trees

> **Select the life areas that are relevant to you right now.** You'll reflect on each one you choose.
>
> Don't overthink it—if an area matters to you, select it. You can always skip questions later.

#### 5C. Per-Tree Deep Dive

**Section intro (shown once before first tree):**

> Each Value Tree has a structure:
>
> - **Roots (Scope)** — What this area of life encompasses for you
> - **Trunk (Standards)** — How you want to show up; the principles that guide you here
> - **Branches (Resolves)** — What you want to achieve or become
> - **Leaves (Outcomes)** — Specific projects, actions, or milestones
>
> For each tree, we'll first define its scope and standards, then reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year ahead. In future years, your resolves and outcomes will carry forward—building on what you've already established.

---

**For EACH selected Value Tree:**

**Tree header:**
> **[VALUE TREE]**

**REFLECT (Look Back + Look Forward)**

| # | Question | Type | Notes |
|---|----------|------|-------|
| 5C.3 | What are you most proud of in [TREE] this year? | textarea | Celebration |
| 5C.4 | Who supported you or showed up for you here? What are you grateful for in this area? | textarea | Gratitude + Relational |
| 5C.5 | What held you back or didn't go the way you hoped? What fears or obstacles got in the way? | textarea | Acknowledgment |
| 5C.6 | What do you want next year? What outcomes, ways of being, or changes are you aspiring to? | textarea | Branches — Resolves/Aspirations |
| 5C.7 | Who or what could help you with this? Is there anyone you know or are aware of who has succeeded doing something similar? | textarea | Help + Mentorship |
| 5C.8 | How satisfied are you with this area of your life right now? | 5-point scale | Satisfaction rating |

**Scale options for 5C.8:**
1. Very dissatisfied
2. Dissatisfied
3. Neutral
4. Satisfied
5. Very satisfied

---

**UI Notes:**
- Show progress indicator: "Tree 3 of 8: Finances"
- Allow "Skip this tree" if user changes their mind
- Consider a "quick mode" toggle: just 5C.3 (proud) + 5C.6 (aspiration) + 5C.8 (satisfaction)
- Year 2+: Pre-fill 5C.1 (Scope) and 5C.2 (Standards) from last year; pre-fill 5C.6 with last year's resolves for review/update

---

#### 5D. Rank Order Your Trees

> You've reflected on each of your Value Trees. Now let's prioritize.
>
> Drag to reorder your selected trees from most important to least important for the coming year. This isn't about which tree is objectively "best"—it's about where you want to focus your energy and attention.

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 5D.1 | Rank your Value Trees in order of priority for the coming year: | drag-and-drop ranking |

**UI Notes:**
- Drag-and-drop interface with numbered positions
- Show tree name + a snippet from their aspiration (5C.4) as context
- Confirmation: "Your top 3 priorities are: 1. [X], 2. [Y], 3. [Z]"

---

#### 5E. Overview - Seeing the Forest

> Now let's zoom out and see the whole forest.

**The Reveal: Your Forest at a Glance**

Before the reflection questions, display a visual summary showing **priority rank + satisfaction together**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR VALUE FOREST (by your priority ranking)               │
│                                                             │
│  Priority    Tree                        Satisfaction       │
│  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────   │
│  1.          Career & Work               ●●●○○ Neutral      │
│  2.          Health & Body               ●●○○○ Dissatisfied │
│  3.          Partnership                 ●●●●○ Satisfied    │
│  4.          Finances                    ●●○○○ Dissatisfied │
│  5.          Learning & Intellect        ●●●●● Very satisfied│
│  6.          Family                      ●●●●○ Satisfied    │
│  7.          Friendships & Community     ●●●○○ Neutral      │
│  8.          Spirituality & Meaning      ●○○○○ Very dissatisfied│
│                                                             │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  🎯 Focus areas (high priority + low satisfaction):         │
│     • Career & Work (Priority #1, Neutral)                  │
│     • Health & Body (Priority #2, Dissatisfied)             │
│     • Finances (Priority #4, Dissatisfied)                  │
│                                                             │
│  ✅ Protect (high priority + high satisfaction):            │
│     • Partnership (Priority #3, Satisfied)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Insight:**
- **Focus areas** = Top priorities with low satisfaction → where to invest energy
- **Protect** = Top priorities with high satisfaction → maintain what's working
- Low priority + low satisfaction → might be okay to deprioritize further

**UI Notes:**
- Ordered by user's priority ranking (from 5D)
- Satisfaction shown alongside each (from 5C.8)
- Auto-highlight "Focus areas" (top half of priorities with satisfaction ≤ Neutral)
- Auto-highlight "Protect" (top half of priorities with satisfaction ≥ Satisfied)

**Reflection Questions:**

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 5E.1 | Looking at your forest, where is the biggest gap between where you are and where you want to be? | textarea |
| 5E.2 | Are there any Value Trees that have shifted in importance this year? Something that used to matter that doesn't anymore, or something newly important? | textarea |
| 5E.3 | How do your different Value Trees affect each other? Where does progress in one area support another? Where do they compete for your time and energy? | textarea |

---

**Design notes:**
- 13 default Value Trees cover major life domains (derived from Henry's 18 + Ness Labs + Gustin)
- 6 pre-selected to reduce friction; user adds/removes as relevant
- "+ Add custom tree" allows unlimited custom additions
- Tree structure education at start: Roots (Scope) → Trunk (Standards) → Branches (Resolves) → Leaves (Outcomes)
- Per-tree flow: SETUP (Scope + Standards) → REFLECT (Proud → Gratitude → Held back → Aspiration → Help → Satisfaction)
- 8 questions per tree (2 setup + 6 reflect)
- Rank ordering happens AFTER filling out trees (informed prioritization)
- "The Reveal" shows all trees ranked by satisfaction—a visual "aha" moment
- Interdependencies question (5E.3) surfaces trade-offs and synergies unique to this template
- Year 2+: Scope, Standards, and prior Resolves pre-fill for continuity
- Total: selection + 8 per-tree + ranking + reveal + 3 reflection

**Length consideration:**
- If user selects 8 trees × 8 questions = 64 questions in deep-dive alone
- Quick mode alternative: just 5C.3 (proud) + 5C.6 (aspiration) + 5C.8 (satisfaction) = 24 questions for 8 trees
- Estimated time: 45-90 min depending on trees selected and depth

### 6. RESTORATION & KEYSTONE HABITS

**Flow:**
```
6A. Section Intro (keystone species framing)
        ↓
6B. Rest & Restoration (what filled your cup)
        ↓
6C. Keystone Behaviors (small actions, outsized impact)
```

---

#### 6A. Section Intro

> In every ecosystem, there are keystone species—organisms whose presence has a disproportionate impact on everything around them. Wolves don't just hunt deer; they reshape rivers, regrow forests, and transform entire landscapes through their presence.
>
> Your habits work the same way. Some behaviors, practiced consistently, have ripple effects far beyond their apparent size. And just as important: how you rest and restore determines whether you have the energy to show up at all.
>
> This section is about finding your keystone habits—and protecting the restoration that makes everything else possible.

---

#### 6B. Rest & Restoration

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 6B.1 | What activities or experiences filled your cup this year versus just filled your time? | textarea |
| 6B.2 | When did you feel most rested and vibrant? What were you doing (or not doing) to cultivate that? | textarea |
| 6B.3 | When throughout the year were you "being" without the need to be "doing"? What is the right balance of those two poles for you? | textarea |
| 6B.4 | What behaviors or beliefs got in the way of your rest this year? Is there anything to be done about those blockers next year? | textarea |

---

#### 6C. Keystone Behaviors

> Some habits have ripple effects far beyond their size. A morning walk doesn't just improve fitness—it changes your mood, your creativity, your patience with others. These are keystone behaviors.
>
> Rather than committing to sweeping changes, think of these as experiments. What might you try in Q1 and learn from?

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 6C.1 | Looking back: What small, repeated actions had the biggest ripple effects on your life this year—for better or worse? | textarea |
| 6C.2 | What are 2-3 keystone behaviors you'd like to experiment with in Q1? Small habits you suspect might have positive ripple effects. Be specific: What time of day would this happen? What comes before or after? What would trigger this behavior? | textarea |
| 6C.3 | Is there a habit you want to experiment with releasing? Something that might be quietly draining you that you'd like to try living without for a month or two. Be specific: When does this habit typically occur? What triggers it? What might you do instead? | textarea |
| 6C.4 | Is there anything that would hinder your ability to add or remove those habits? What can you do, or who can you tap, to help you overcome those blockers? | textarea |

---

**Design notes:**
- Keystone species framing connects to Value Forest ecosystem metaphor
- Rest & Restoration comes FIRST—energy enables everything else
- "Filled your cup vs. filled your time" is intuitive and distinct
- "Most rested and vibrant" focuses on peak states, not generic satisfaction
- Blockers framed as behaviors/beliefs (changeable), not external threats
- Keystone behaviors framed as Q1 experiments—low stakes, learnable
- "Experiment with releasing" applies same experimental mindset to removal
- Final question does CBT-style obstacle anticipation + support identification
- "Being vs. Doing" question adds contemplative dimension beyond just energy management
- Total: 8 questions (4 rest + 4 keystone)

**Inspirations:**
- *The Power of Habit* (Charles Duhigg) — trigger-routine-reward loop; understanding cues
- *The Willpower Instinct* (Kelly McGonigal) — specificity in habit planning, implementation intentions
- *Atomic Habits* (James Clear) — habit stacking, making habits obvious/attractive/easy/satisfying
- *Tiny Habits* (BJ Fogg) — small experiments, celebrating tiny wins, anchor behaviors

### 7. WAYFINDING - Charting the Path Ahead

**Flow:**
```
7A. Section Intro
        ↓
7B. Meeting Your Future Self (Guided Visualization)
        ↓
7C. Big Questions (Feynman-inspired)
        ↓
7D. Feel / Become / Experience
        ↓
7E. Theme for the Year
```

---

#### 7A. Section Intro

> You've mapped the terrain of your past year. You've examined your ecosystem—your values, your habits, your energy. Now it's time for wayfinding: charting the path ahead.
>
> This isn't about rigid planning. It's about orienting yourself—understanding where you want to go and how you want to travel. Give yourself permission to want what you actually want, not what you think you should want.

---

#### 7B. Meeting Your Future Self (Guided Visualization)

> *This is a guided visualization. Find a comfortable position, take a few breaths, and let yourself settle.*
>
> **Your Happy Place**
> Close your eyes. Picture yourself in your happy place—somewhere you feel completely safe and at peace. It might be real or imagined. Notice the details: What do you see around you? What do you hear? What's the temperature like? Let yourself arrive fully in this space.
>
> **Movement**
> Now, begin to move through this space. Walk slowly. Feel the ground beneath your feet. Notice how your body feels as you move. There's no rush.
>
> **A Presence**
> As you walk, you sense someone nearby. You're not startled—this presence feels safe, familiar somehow. You turn toward them.
>
> **Meeting Yourself**
> It's you. Thirty years from now. This version of you has lived a full life and carries wisdom you don't yet have.
>
> Take a moment to observe them: How are they dressed? How do they hold themselves? What do their eyes and smile say? How do they engage with you?
>
> They have something very important to tell you. They ask you to take a seat near them and listen.

**After the visualization:**

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 7B.1 | What did they tell you? What did they want you to know? | textarea |
| 7B.2 | What did they encourage you to prioritize—or let go of? | textarea |

---

#### 7C. Big Questions (Feynman-Inspired)

> Richard Feynman kept a list of his "favorite problems"—questions he was always turning over in his mind. Not questions with easy answers, but the kind you carry with you, returning to them again and again as you move through life.
>
> I love Feynman's way of approaching the world with wonder and curiosity. Rather than rushing to answers, he held big questions loosely—letting them guide his attention without demanding resolution.

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 7C.1 | What are 3-6 big questions you're holding for your life right now? Questions you don't have answers to, but that feel important to keep asking. | textarea |

**Examples (if helpful):**
- What would it feel like to be completely at peace with myself?
- How do I want to be remembered by the people I love?
- What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?
- What am I avoiding that I know I need to face?
- What does "enough" actually look like for me?

---

#### 7D. Feel / Become / Experience

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 7D.1 | How do you want to FEEL next year? Not what you want to accomplish—how you want to experience your days. What emotional texture do you want your life to have? | textarea |
| 7D.2 | Who do you want to BECOME in the coming year? What qualities, capacities, or ways of being do you want to develop? | textarea |
| 7D.3 | What do you want to EXPERIENCE next year? What moments, adventures, or milestones are you looking forward to—or want to create? | textarea |

---

#### 7E. Theme for the Year

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 7E.1 | What word or theme do you want to carry into the coming year? | text |
| 7E.2 | What does this theme mean to you? How will you embody it? | textarea |

**Henry's approach:**
> I've had years guided by words like "Depth," "Presence," "Integration." The word doesn't have to be perfect—it's a compass, not a contract. Let it find you.

---

**Design notes:**
- "Wayfinding" continues the nature/journey metaphor—charting your path through the landscape you've mapped
- Section intro frames this as orienting, not rigid planning
- 7B is a full guided visualization (not just a question)—creates immersive experience
- Future self is "30 years from now" (not 80) to work for various ages
- Visualization builds: happy place → movement → presence → meeting → listening
- Feynman section framed with Henry's personal appreciation for his approach
- Feel/Become/Experience trio is distinct from "achieve"—somatic and identity-focused
- Theme question split into two: the word itself (short) and what it means (deeper)
- Total: 7 questions (2 visualization + 1 Feynman + 3 Feel/Become/Experience + 1 theme meaning)
- Note: 7E.1 (theme word) is a short text input, not a full textarea

### 8. GROUND IT - From Aspirations to Action

**Flow:**
```
8A. Section Intro
        ↓
8B. The Aspirations Summary (pull forward all "do better" items)
        ↓
8C. Q1 Focus (what to prioritize now)
        ↓
8D. Creating Space (the power of no + don't do list)
        ↓
8E. Defining Success
```

---

#### 8A. Section Intro

> You've done a lot of dreaming. You've set aspirations across your Value Trees, identified keystone habits to experiment with, and charted the path ahead.
>
> Now let's get grounded. The truth is: you probably can't do all the things all at once. And that's okay. This section is about choosing what to focus on *first*—not forever, just for Q1.
>
> Think of this as tending your garden. You can't plant everything in one season. What will you nurture first? What can wait until the soil is ready?

---

#### 8B. The Aspirations Summary

> Before you prioritize, let's see everything in one place. Here are the aspirations and "do better" intentions you've expressed throughout this review:

**Auto-generated summary (pulled from earlier responses):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR ASPIRATIONS (from Value Trees - top 5 by priority)    │
│                                                             │
│  1. Career & Work: [their 5C.6 response excerpt]           │
│  2. Health & Body: [their 5C.6 response excerpt]           │
│  3. Partnership: [their 5C.6 response excerpt]             │
│  4. Finances: [their 5C.6 response excerpt]                │
│  5. Learning & Intellect: [their 5C.6 response excerpt]    │
│                                                             │
│  KEYSTONE HABITS TO EXPERIMENT WITH (from Section 6):       │
│  • [their 6C.2 response excerpt]                           │
│                                                             │
│  THEME FOR THE YEAR: [their 7E.1 response]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**UI Notes:**
- Auto-pull aspirations from 5C.6 for top 5 priority-ranked trees
- Include keystone habits from 6C.2
- Include annual theme from 7E.1
- This is a "reveal" moment—seeing everything together

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 8B.1 | Looking at all of this together, what stands out? Is there anything you want to add, remove, or reframe? | textarea |

---

#### 8C. Q1 Focus

> You can't do everything at once. What will you focus on in Q1?

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 8C.1 | Of all your aspirations, what 2-3 things do you want to focus on in Q1? These aren't your only priorities—just where you'll direct your energy first. | textarea |
| 8C.2 | What would have to change in your life to make room for these Q1 priorities? What's currently taking up space that shouldn't be? | textarea |

**Henry's approach:**
> I aim for 60-70% achievement on my aspirations across the year. If I hit 100%, I wasn't dreaming big enough. If I hit 30%, I overcommitted. Focusing on 2-3 things per quarter means I can actually make progress instead of spreading myself thin.

---

#### 8D. Creating Space (The Power of No)

> Saying "yes" to your priorities means saying "no" to other things. Let's make that explicit—and give yourself permission to defer what doesn't fit right now.

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 8D.1 | What's one thing you will say NO to in Q1 to create space for what you do want? | textarea |
| 8D.2 | What are 2-3 aspirations from your list that you'll put on your "Don't Do" list for Q1? Things that matter, but that you're giving yourself permission to pick up later. | textarea |

**The Don't Do List:**
> This isn't about abandoning your aspirations—it's about sequencing them. Putting something on your "Don't Do" list for Q1 means you're consciously choosing to focus elsewhere first. It creates exhale. You can pick these up in Q2 or beyond.

---

#### 8E. Defining Success

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 8E.1 | For your 2-3 Q1 priorities: What would "done" or "success" look like? How would you know you made meaningful progress? | textarea |
| 8E.2 | For each priority, is this something brand new (requiring activation energy to start) or building on existing momentum? | textarea |

**Why this matters:**
> New initiatives require more activation energy than continuing something already in motion. Knowing this helps you be realistic about how much you can take on. One brand-new initiative plus one or two "continuing" priorities is often the right balance.

---

**Design notes:**
- Section intro uses garden metaphor (can't plant everything in one season)
- 8B is a "reveal" moment—auto-pull aspirations from earlier sections into one view
- Focus is explicitly on Q1, not the whole year (less overwhelming, more actionable)
- "Don't Do" list reframes "no" as permission to defer, not abandon
- Activation energy question moved here from Section 6 (where it felt clunky)
- Language throughout is experimental/invitational, not heavy/prescriptive
- Total: 6 questions + aspirations summary display

**Inspirations:**
- *Essentialism* (Greg McKeown) — the disciplined pursuit of less
- *The ONE Thing* (Gary Keller) — focus and priority forcing
- Quarterly planning cycles (12-week year concept)

### 9. COMMITMENT - Closing the Arc

**Flow:**
```
9A. Section Intro (arriving at New Bliss)
        ↓
9B. Letter to Future Self
        ↓
9C. First Step (activation)
        ↓
9D. Gratitude Close
        ↓
9E. Final Reflection (bookend)
```

---

#### 9A. Section Intro

> You've done the work.
>
> You've walked through the forest of your year—remembered what bloomed, acknowledged what withered, noticed the patterns in the undergrowth. You've surveyed your Value Trees, tended to your keystone habits, and charted the path ahead.
>
> Now it's time to mark this moment. Not with rigid resolutions, but with intention. A letter to yourself. A single first step. And a closing of the circle.

---

#### 9B. Letter to Future Self

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 9B.1 | Write a letter to yourself one year from now. What do you hope you'll be able to say when you read this? What do you want to remind yourself of? What commitments are you making to yourself? | textarea |

**Prompt suggestions (if helpful):**
> Dear Future Me,
>
> This time next year, I hope you...
>
> I want you to remember that...
>
> I'm committing to...
>
> Don't forget...
>
> With love, [Present You]

**Henry's approach:**
> I actually schedule this letter to arrive via email on December 15th of the following year. Reading last year's letter while doing this year's review is one of my favorite moments—sometimes I've exceeded what I hoped for, sometimes I laugh at what I thought mattered, and sometimes I'm reminded of something I'd forgotten. Either way, it's a gift from Past Me.

---

#### 9C. First Step

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 9C.1 | What is ONE action you can take in the next 48 hours to begin living into your intentions? Something small but concrete that creates momentum. | textarea |

---

#### 9D. The Witness

| # | Question | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 9D.1 | Some people publish their reviews online. Others share with their closest friends and loved ones. Is there anyone you want to share aspects of this review—or your 2026 aspirations—with? | textarea |

| 9E.2 | What did you discover that you didn't expect? | textarea |
| 9E.3 | What is one question you wished we asked—or you answered—that wasn't included in this review? | textarea |

---

#### 9F. Closing Ritual

> *(Placeholder—to be refined during UI development)*
>
> Congratulations. You've completed your Annual Review.
>
> What you've written here is a seed catalog for the year ahead. You've mapped the landscape, surveyed your forest, and chosen what to cultivate first. Not everything will grow the way you expect—and that's okay. The garden is alive; it will teach you as you tend it.
>
> Return to this review throughout the year. Let it guide your seasons. Let it remind you of who you were becoming when you wrote this.
>
> Now, go plant something.
>
> — Henry

---

**Design notes:**
- Section intro updated to "closing of the circle" language
- Letter to Future Self gets substantial space + prompt suggestions + scheduling tip
- 9C.1 (first step) creates immediate activation energy—don't let insights die
- 9D reframed as "The Witness"—sharing as accountability, not obligation
- 9E pulls forward the opening intention (1C.1) for bookend moment
- 9E.2 changed to "what did you discover" (more specific)
- 9E.3 meta-question for template improvement and user reflection
- Closing ritual is placeholder—to be refined during UI work
- "Go plant something" is the call to action (not "go achieve things")
- Total: 6 questions + closing ritual

**Inspirations:**
- *The Artist's Way* (Julia Cameron) — morning pages and letters to self
- FutureMe.org — time-capsule letter concept
- James Clear on identity-based habits ("every action is a vote for who you want to become")

## Open Design Questions (Resolved)

1. ✅ **Value Forest handling:** Branching question offers custom trees OR default 8 life areas
2. ✅ **Per-tree depth:** 6 questions per tree with potential for abbreviated mode
3. ✅ **Optional questions:** All questions optional; can click through at own pace
4. ✅ **Help text:** Added examples throughout (Feynman questions, letter prompts, etc.)

## Remaining Implementation Notes

1. **Intro letter:** Placeholder is from 2023 doc; may want to refine/personalize further
2. **Value Forest branching:** Need UI to handle custom tree entry vs. default selection
3. **Abbreviated mode:** Consider offering per-section "quick" vs "deep" options
4. **Progress saving:** Essential for multi-session completion
5. **Export:** Markdown export should preserve section structure and all responses
